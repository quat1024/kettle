# kettle.html

Experiment in a couple things:

* Develop software *entirely* in a web browser. The first versions of `kettle.html` (<1kb) were made by modifying `about:blank` in firefox devtools. All later versions were made by interacting with previous versions of `kettle.html` and clicking the "save" button embedded on the page, without editing the page in devtools.
* "homoiconic" software. The program exposes its *entire* source code in its own user interface. You can edit it live; most changes take effect without a refresh.
* Inspired a bit by literate programming, Zettelkasten notes, tiddlywiki, ...

Don't get your hopes up, it's not too interesting. You can't hide or reorder cards atm.

import-downloads-folder is a Deno script that copies `kettle(21).html` files out of my downloads folder and presents them in a linear Git history. The commit dates are wrong.
